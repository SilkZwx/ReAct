Her other film appearances include The Secret Garden (1993), Beyond the Clouds (1995), U.S. Marshals (1998), and Eternity (2016).. Irène Jacob was born in Suresnes, Hauts-de-Seine, a western suburb of Paris.[3] The youngest child with three older brothers, she was raised in a highly educated and intellectual family and environment: her father, Maurice Jacob, was a physicist; her mother, a psychologist; one brother, Francis Jacob, a musician; and her other two brothers, scientists.[4][5] In 1969, at the age of three, Irène moved with her family to Geneva, Switzerland, where she became interested in the arts.. My family was very shy with feelings and never spoke about them, but we evolved a little bit.\n",
